# MNIST Benford's Law Analysis
This was a test if MNIST images generated by a GAN would follow [Benford's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law), as porposed by Bonettini et. al. in their paper [On the use of Benford's law to detect GAN-generated images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07682).

unfortunately due to exams I was not able to finish this project (for now).
